# ✅ Enhanced Backup Status Command

## 🎯 Problem Solved

The backup status command was showing confusing technical process messages that weren't helpful:
```
Process 304955 dead!
Process 304955 detected
Process 304995 dead!
Process 304995 detected
```

## 🛠️ Enhancement Applied

1. **Filtered Out Technical Noise**:
   - ❌ "Process XXX dead!" messages
   - ❌ "Process XXX detected" messages  
   - ❌ "CPU limit...Nice...I/O priority" details
   - ❌ "Running CPU-limited...rsync" details

2. **Added Helpful Summary**:
   - 📊 Backup operations count
   - 🧹 Cleanup tasks count  
   - 📈 Clear activity overview

3. **Improved Readability**:
   - Clean, user-friendly output
