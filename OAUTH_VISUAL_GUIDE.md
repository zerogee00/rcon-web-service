## üîß Troubleshooting OAuth Issues

### Issue: "This app isn't responding"
**Solution**: Check that all 3 scopes are added and app is reinstalled

### Issue: Commands don't autocomplete
**Solution**: Ensure `commands` scope is added and app is installed

### Issue: Bot doesn't respond
**Solution**: Check `chat:write` scope is added

### Issue: Bot can't post in channel
**Solution**: Add `chat:write.public` scope and reinstall

## üìû Final Verification Script

Test your OAuth setup with these commands in Slack:

```
/players
/mc 7eaa7ab6 list
/mc b46f4016 tps
```

If all three work, your OAuth is configured correctly! üéâ
